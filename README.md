# Data-Science-and-Python-work
It contains my course work and project for Data Science, Data Mining, Bioinformatics, and Digital Image Processing classes.

## Data Science
### Post-Storm Imegery Classification
Description: I build a model to classify and analysis post-storm images from NOAA to help researchers to study the effects of storms. I created python code to compress large images and to find the center of an image. I did statistical analysis with the data such as basic statistics, distribution modeling, hypothesis testing, correlation and coveriance.

Class and work type: Data Science and group project.

Programming language and tools: Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm.

Frames and libraries: pandas, numpy, csv, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, scipy, math.
