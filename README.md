It contains my course work and project for Data Science, Data Mining, Bioinformatics, and Digital Image Processing classes.

## Data Science
### Post-Storm Imegery Classification
**Description:** I build a model to classify and analysis post-storm images from NOAA to help researchers to study the effects of storms. I created python code to compress large images and to find the center of an image. I did statistical analysis with the data such as basic statistics, distribution modeling, hypothesis testing, correlation and coveriance.\
**Work type:** group project.\
**Programming language and tools:** Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm.\
**Frames and libraries:** pandas, numpy, csv, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, scipy, math.\
