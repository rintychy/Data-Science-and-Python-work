# Data-Science-and-Python-work
It contains my course work and project for Data Science, Data Mining, Bioinformatics, and Digital Image Processing classes.

## Data Science
### Post-Storm Imegery Classification
**Description:** I build a model to classify and analysis post-storm images from NOAA to help researchers to study the effects of storms. I created python code to compress large images and to find the center of an image. I did statistical analysis with the data such as basic statistics, distribution modeling, hypothesis testing, correlation and coveriance.\
**Work type:** group project.\
**Programming language and tools:** Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm.\
**Frames and libraries:** pandas, numpy, csv, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, scipy, math.
### Find best date night movie and survival rate of titanic by age, sex, and class
**Description:** Using Joining, Groupby, Sorting, find the best date night movie and titanic passengers survival ratio by age, class, and sex.\
**Work type:** Individual course work.\
**Programming language and tools:** Python 3, Jupyter Notebook.\
**Frames and libraries:** OS, pandas, HTML.
### Random team generator
**Description:** I created a algorithm of random team generator based on the given team number.\
**Work type:** Individual course work.\
**Programming language and tools:** Python 3, Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Mining
### Association Rule Mining Algorithm
**Description:** Mining interesting association rule between movies based on it's genre and rating using Apriori algorithm.\
**Work type:** Individual course work.\
**Programming language and tools:** Python 3, Jupyter Notebook.\
